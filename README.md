----

## Project Description
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: The difference and similarity among horror stories of different authors

+ This project is conducted by Xiangyu Liu, Columbia UNI: xl2703

+ Project summary: My goal is to identify and illustrate similarities and differences identified by text mining. Since it is the spooky text dataset, I pay more attention on the comparision between fear words and joy words. If you are also curious about it, please wait and see!
